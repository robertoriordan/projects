						<dd>El Luchador Con Hambre is notable for being one of Cork's very few traditional Mexican Restaurants. Located in the centre of the city in the quite cosy William Street, from the minute you enter you can sense the warm atmosphere. Staff beam from ear to ear as warm delicious food is served to each table, and what food it is.<br/><br/>The Mexican food here is quite unlike anything else in the rest of Cork. You can almost taste the care that was put into each bite. Wonderful combinations of flavours dance around your mouth and you start to wonder what you have been doing with your life up until this point. Who cares about food reviews? Who cares about family, friends and other obligations? All that matters is El Luchador Con Hambre!!!<dd>
